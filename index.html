                        Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was a charismatic leader who
                        organized an argument and uprising against the British
                        in India, guided the Bengalis of East Pakistan in their
                        resistance to the unjust actions of the postcolonial
                        Pakistani government, and finally helped create the
                        independent nation of Bangladesh in 1971. He headed the
                        Awami League and was the first President of Bangladesh
                        during the Bangladesh Liberation War, and later became
                        Prime Minister in independent Bangladesh. He is
                        popularly referred to as Sheikh Mujib, with the honorary
                        title of Bangabandhu ( Bongobondhu, “Friend of Bengal”).
                        His eldest daughter, Sheikh Hasina, is the present
                        leader of the Awami League and the current (17 march
                        2015) Prime Minister of Bangladesh.
                        Bangabandhu Sheik
                        Mujibur Rahman was the planner of our nation and the
                        country by all complexity of the period. Indeed, what we
                        now call Bangladesh was never independent in the most
                        genuine feeling of the term before 1971. It was Mujib
                        and just Mujib who gave the country a genuine touch of
                        opportunity. It was truly a trek into the long method
                        for the opportunity from full-scale mistreatment through
                        self-sufficiency and home run in which he gave the
                        dynamic lead.
